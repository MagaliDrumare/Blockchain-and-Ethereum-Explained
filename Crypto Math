# What is Cryptography? 
-> Sentence -> Cipher 
-> Cryptography deals with encryption, decryption, hashing ans digital signatures. 

# Encryption 
->Symmetric cryptography, asymmetric cryptography, hashing 
encrypt with public key 
decrypt with private key 
-> Symetric cryptography, asymetric cryptography and hashing. 
-> One key on both sides encryption and decryption = symetric. 
-> Two different keys [public and secret/private key] on both sides = asymetric. 
-> Static Hash function : convert key into a hash. 


# Digital signatures => proof of ownership. 
-> Use of a private and a public keys for encryption and a private key for decryption. 

# Example of cryptography. 
-> https 
-> whatsapp : the server can't read what happen with the two parties. 
-> OpenMined for AI. 
-> Today : AI at the edges + man at the center (Uber)
-> Tomorrow : AI at the center and the edges -> Need to trust the AI through blockchain and encryption. 

# Zero Knowledge proof (ZKP)
->How I prove I know something without telling what I know? 
-> Proof of statement : convincing the verifier that a statement is true without yielding anay other information. 
-> Proof of knowledge : convincing the verifier one knows a secret 
Cryptography is mainly based on proof of knowledge. 

# zkSNARKS 
-> zero-knowledge Succint Non-interactive aRguments of Knowledge.
